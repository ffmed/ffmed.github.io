I am a junior researcher and medical doctor at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany. My research focuses on early detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer, with a particular emphasis on PSMA imaging, fusion biopsy, and radioguided surgery techniques. My work aims to improve the interaction of modern imaging modalities and surgical techniques in the realm of prostate cancer.
